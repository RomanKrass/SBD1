## Introduction

- Overview of Judgment-Based Forecasting
- Why are Judgmental Methods important?


## Judgmental Methods

- What are Judgmental Forecasting Methods?
- Six Types:
  - Single Expert
  - Expert and Group Opinion
  - Jury of Expert Opinion
  - Sales Force Projections
  - Customer Surveys
  - Use of Analogies


## Single Expert (or Unaidered Judgment)

- Relies on the judgment of a single expert to provide a forecast.
- Commonly used when a single individual is perceived to have superior knowledge or insight.
- Advantage: Can yield excellent forecasts if the expert is well-qualified and unbiased.
- Limitations:
  - Risk of systematic biases if the expert has personal prejudices or wishful thinking
  - Difficulty in identifying truly qualified experts.
- Example: A financial analyst providing a forecast for the stock market based on their analysis of economic indicators, market trends, and company performance.


## Expert and Group Opinion

- Involves harnessing expertise, either individual or collective, to provide forecasts
- Utilized in various contexts, including betting markets, executive committees, and focus groups.
- Advantage: Combines multiple viewpoints and expertise, potentially improving forecast accuracy.
- Limitations:
  - Risk of groupthink, where dissenting viewpoints are suppressed, leading to biased forecasts.
  - Political considerations may influence the consensus, compromising the objectivity of the forecast.
- Examples: A team of executives from sales, marketing, and finance departments convening to discuss and agree upon sales forecasts for the upcoming quarter as part of the Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) process.


## Jury of Expert Opinion

- Involves bringing together a group of experts with different responsibilities to provide a forecast.
- Often part of the Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) process in companies.
- Advantage: Incorporates a range of managerial viewpoints into the forecasting process
- Limitations:
  - Forecasts and targets may become confused, leading to potential inaccuracies.
  - Political considerations can influence the debate, leading to biases in the forecast.
- Example: A consumer goods company assembling a cross-functional team of experts from marketing, production, and finance departments to collaboratively forecast sales for a new product launch.

## Sales Force Projections

- Utilizes information from a company's sales force to forecast future sales.
- Particularly useful when quantitative data are limited, such as for new products or markets.
- Advantage: Capitalizes on sales representatives' firsthand knowledge of customer interactions and market conditions.
- Limitations:
  - Risk of biased forecasts if management uses projections to set sales targets.
  - Difficulty in aggregating individual forecasts without accounting for potential reporting biases.
- Example: A multinational corporation relying on input from its regional sales teams to forecast demand for its products in different geographic markets.

## Customer Surveys

- Collects data directly from customers regarding their purchasing intentions.
- Used to measure demand for products or services and inform sales forecasts.
- Advantage: Provides direct access to customer insights and preferences.
- Limitation: Risk of response biases or discrepancies between stated intentions and actual behavior.
- Example: A car manufacturer conducting a survey to assess consumer preferences and intentions to purchase electric vehicles over the next year.

## Use of Analogies

- Involves making judgments based on similarities between the current situation and past experiences or similar situations.
- Used to forecast outcomes by identifying analogous situations and leveraging historical data or past events.
- Advantage: Provides a structured approach to forecasting, especially when historical data or quantitative methods are limited.
- Limitations:
  - Relies on subjective judgment in identifying analogies, which may introduce biases or overlook relevant differences.
  - Risk of over-reliance on a single analogy or characteristic, leading to inaccurate forecasts.
- Example: A retail chain using historical sales data from similar promotions or product launches to forecast the impact of an upcoming marketing campaign.

## Recommendations

- Single Expert: Ensure the expert has a deep understanding of the subject matter. However, be aware of potential biases and consider using this method in conjunction with others to balance out any individual bias.
- Expert and Group Opinion: Encourage open and respectful dialogue among the group. Diverse perspectives can lead to a more comprehensive forecast. Use structured techniques like the Delphi method to avoid groupthink.
- Jury of Expert Opinion: Similar to the above, but ensure the jury is made up of experts in the relevant field. The diversity of the jury can help balance out individual biases and lead to a more accurate forecast.


## Recommendations
- Sales Force Projections: Regularly train the sales force in forecasting and provide them with clear instructions and guidance. Their close contact with the market can provide valuable insights, but these projections may be influenced by their personal sales targets.
- Customer Surveys: Ensure the survey is designed well to avoid leading questions and bias. Itâ€™s also important to have a representative sample of customers for the survey.
- Use of Analogies: Be cautious when drawing analogies, as situations may appear similar but have different underlying factors. This method should be used as a supplement to other methods, rather than a standalone forecasting tool.

## Conclusion

- Judgmental forecasting methods play a crucial role in decision-making and planning.
- Each method has its strengths and limitations, requiring careful consideration and evaluation when selecting an approach.
- Subject to various biases and personal judgment
