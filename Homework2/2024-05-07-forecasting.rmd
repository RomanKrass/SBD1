## Introduction

- Overview of Judgment-Based Forecasting
- Why are Judgmental Methods important?


## Judgmental Methods

- What are Judgmental Forecasting Methods?
- Six Types:
  - Single Expert
  - Expert and Group Opinion
  - Jury of Expert Opinion
  - Sales Force Projections
  - Customer Surveys
  - Use of Analogies


## Single Expert (or Unaidered Judgment)

- Relies on the judgment of a single expert to provide a forecast.
- Commonly used when a single individual is perceived to have superior knowledge or insight.
- Advantage: Can yield excellent forecasts if the expert is well-qualified and unbiased.
- Limitations:
  - Risk of systematic biases if the expert has personal prejudices or wishful thinking
  - Difficulty in identifying truly qualified experts.
- Example: A financial analyst providing a forecast for the stock market based on their analysis of economic indicators, market trends, and company performance.


## Expert and Group Opinion

- Involves harnessing expertise, either individual or collective, to provide forecasts
- Utilized in various contexts, including betting markets, executive committees, and focus groups.
- Advantage: Combines multiple viewpoints and expertise, potentially improving forecast accuracy.
- Limitations:
  - Risk of groupthink, where dissenting viewpoints are suppressed, leading to biased forecasts.
  - Political considerations may influence the consensus, compromising the objectivity of the forecast.
- Examples: A team of executives from sales, marketing, and finance departments convening to discuss and agree upon sales forecasts for the upcoming quarter as part of the Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) process.


## Jury of Expert Opinion

- Involves bringing together a group of experts with different responsibilities to provide a forecast.
- Often part of the Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) process in companies.
- Advantage: Incorporates a range of managerial viewpoints into the forecasting process
- Limitations:
  - Forecasts and targets may become confused, leading to potential inaccuracies.
  - Political considerations can influence the debate, leading to biases in the forecast.
- Example: A consumer goods company assembling a cross-functional team of experts from marketing, production, and finance departments to collaboratively forecast sales for a new product launch.

## Sales Force Projections

- Utilizes information from a company's sales force to forecast future sales.
- Particularly useful when quantitative data are limited, such as for new products or markets.
- Advantage: Capitalizes on sales representatives' firsthand knowledge of customer interactions and market conditions.
- Limitations:
  - Risk of biased forecasts if management uses projections to set sales targets.
  - Difficulty in aggregating individual forecasts without accounting for potential reporting biases.
- Example: A multinational corporation relying on input from its regional sales teams to forecast demand for its products in different geographic markets.

## Customer Surveys

- Collects data directly from customers regarding their purchasing intentions.
- Used to gauge demand for products or services and inform sales forecasts.
- Advantage: Provides direct access to customer insights and preferences.
- Limitation: Risk of response biases or discrepancies between stated intentions and actual behavior.
- Example: A car manufacturer conducting a survey to assess consumer preferences and intentions to purchase electric vehicles over the next year.

## Use of Analogies

- Involves making judgments based on similarities between the current situation and past experiences or similar situations.
- Used to forecast outcomes by identifying analogous situations and leveraging historical data or past events.
- Advantage: Provides a structured approach to forecasting, especially when historical data or quantitative methods are limited.
- Limitations:
  - Relies on subjective judgment in identifying analogies, which may introduce biases or overlook relevant differences.
  - Risk of over-reliance on a single analogy or characteristic, leading to inaccurate forecasts.
- Example: A retail chain using historical sales data from similar promotions or product launches to forecast the impact of an upcoming marketing campaign.
